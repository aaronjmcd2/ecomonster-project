# Golem Monster Guide
Version: 1.0 | Created: May 2025

## Overview
The Golem is a resource processing creature that combines lava with various materials to create valuable products. 
It serves as a competitor in the ecosystem, creating interesting ecological dynamics.

## Core Behaviors
- Gathers lava from lava tiles
- Collects various ores and stones
- Processes these resources into ingots and concrete
- Moves between resource gathering and production phases

## Resource Management
The Golem maintains separate storage systems:
- Lava Storage: Dedicated space for stored lava (max_lava_storage)
- Material Storage: Shared space for all solid materials (max_material_storage)

## Production Recipes
The Golem can produce:
1. Lava + Stone → Reinforced Concrete
2. Lava + Iron Ore → Iron Ingots
3. Lava + Silver Ore → Silver Ingots
4. Lava + Gold Ore → Gold Ingots
5. Lava + Aetherdrift Ore → Aetherdrift Ingots

## Configuration Parameters
Tunable parameters to adjust the Golem's behavior:
- max_lava_storage: Maximum lava storage capacity
- max_material_storage: Maximum material storage capacity
- reinforced_concrete_yield: Number of concrete blocks produced per recipe
- [iron/silver/gold/aetherdrift]_ingot_yield: Number of ingots produced per recipe
- lava_required: Amount of lava needed per recipe
- material_required: Amount of material needed per recipe
- search_radius_tiles/px: How far the Golem searches for resources
- move_speed: Movement speed
- cooldown_time: Time between production cycles

## Modular Architecture
The Golem uses the standard modular system:
- GolemInitModule: Handles initialization
- GolemMovementModule: Controls movement
- GolemSearchModule: Finds resources
- GolemConsumptionModule: Consumes resources
- GolemProductionModule: Creates products
- GolemStatsModule: Tracks efficiency
- GolemUIModule: Handles UI interactions

## Ecosystem Role
The Golem competes with other creatures for resources:
- Competes with Dragons for lava
- Competes with Worms for ores and stones
- Acts as a competitor in the ecosystem, potentially creating resource scarcity

## Integration Notes
The Golem creates interesting ecological dynamics:
- With high numbers, can cause ecosystem collapse through competition
- Can be tuned to be more or less competitive by adjusting parameters
- Creates a realistic competitive exclusion scenario in the simulated ecosystem

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Create new resource types only Golem can use
- Add resource contribution back to ecosystem
- Develop territorial behavior to avoid other creatures
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on ecosystem health
